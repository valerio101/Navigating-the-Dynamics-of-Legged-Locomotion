# Navigating-the-Dynamics-of-Legged-Locomotion
Inspired by 'From centroidal to whole-body models,' I explored how model choice impacts MPC performance. Comparing simplified vs. full dynamics taught me to balance computational speed with physical precision. I now have a deeper, intuitive grasp of the strategic trade-offs required for stable and efficient legged locomotion.
